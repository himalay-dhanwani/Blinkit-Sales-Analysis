Blinkit Sales Data Analysis
📌 Overview
This project analyzes Blinkit sales data to uncover insights on sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I cleaned and transformed the dataset, built key performance indicators (KPIs), and developed interactive dashboards for decision-making.

⚙️ Tech Stack
SQL – Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation queries
Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for preprocessing & visualization
Power BI – Interactive dashboards, DAX measures, and KPI tracking

🎯 Business Requirements & KPIs
The analysis focused on answering critical business questions through the following KPIs:
Total Sales – Overall revenue generated
Average Sales – Revenue per transaction
Number of Items – Total count of sold items
Average Rating – Customer satisfaction indicator
Additional granular insights:
Sales by Fat Content
Sales by Item Type
Sales trends by Outlet Establishment Year
Sales distribution by Outlet Size and Location
Comprehensive metrics by Outlet Type

🛠️ Data Cleaning
Standardized inconsistent values in Item_Fat_Content (e.g., LF, low fat → Low Fat, reg → Regular) using SQL update queries.
Removed null values and duplicates for accurate aggregations.
Validated cleaned data with exploratory queries in SQL and Python.

📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
KPI Cards – Total Sales, Average Sales, Items Sold, Average Rating
Bar & Line Charts – Sales by Item Type, Fat Content, Establishment Year
Pie/Donut Charts – Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size
